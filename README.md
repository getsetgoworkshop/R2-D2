# R2-D2
The Arduino code here controls the main functions of my R2-D2 droid.

Note that the sounds files are categorized, and must be configured in a single folder with each file numbered as follows:

1.mp3
2.mp3
3....  through all of the sound file names (1-176).  The categorized sounds must be consecutive.  I.e. scream sounds must be consecutive files, happy sounds must be consecutive files, etc.

The code provided uses the following sound groupings and file numbers:
1.mp3 - 16.mp3 Mischief (joystick back left)
17 - 34 Happy (joystick back)
35 - 41 Question (joystick back right)
42 - 53 Ooh (joystick left)
54 - 99 Chat (joystick center)
100 - 131 Yell (joystick right)
132 - 145 Scared (joystick forward left)
146 - 172 Annoyed (joystick forward)
173 - 176 Scream (joystick forward right)
